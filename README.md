# 💫 About Me:
🔭 currently working on trying to convince my code to work on the first try <br>👯 looking to collaborate on anything that doesn’t require getting out of my pajamas. But seriously, full-stack projects, and if it involves AI, count me in!<br>🤝 looking for help with debugging, life advice, and maybe how to train my plants to water themselves.<br>🌱 currently learning how to be a code ninja 🥷 and not accidentally crash my computer while doing it.<br>💬 Ask me about code, startups, and my latest battle with bugs (it’s a never-ending war).<br>
